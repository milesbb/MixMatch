<h2 align="center">Mission Statement</h2>

<p align="center">According to a 2021 <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/music-and-streaming-market-study-update-paper/executive-summary">study</a> by the UK Government, there were 39 million monthly active users of music streaming services within the UK with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/21/younger-consumers-use-two-or-more-apps-for-streaming-music-mobile-messaging-says-nielsen/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAG3YNpgcPUj6w4i0w-fB695mZUUmL9Fs-lwDSi2kbeyvfrmsIqczLeuScoA7hqn8_23_PwDE3B2BV2bCj85JnO3aIlxgbwWHXXJhuFGmjxTDwZ0zUYVaS7sQc4WbbBV3Xd-YcxuYtOt-IAGp02w9dKRrBfqvaW-PKmBYZCXPMN0Y">other figures</a> showing that in 2017 up to 60 percent of young people in the US use multiple streaming services at the same time. Despite this, the most popular music streaming platforms today offer no easy way to export user-created playlists to other platforms.</p>

<p align="center">Thats where <strong>MixMatch</strong> comes in!</p>

<p align="center">MixMatch aims to plug this gap and provide an easy and accessible way for users of streaming services who may want to transfer their awesome playlists between apps. Sarah will now be able to transfer her tough 70 song-long workout playlist from Spotify to Apple Music so her friend Abby, who only uses Apple Music, will be able to collaborate on it with her!</p>

<p align="center">Through dynamic use of Spotify, Apple Music, etc... API's, MixMatch will be able to offer you a simple and clean way to preserve, move, and share your favorite playlists!</p>

<p align="center">Primary framework: React. Bootstrap styling, react-router-dom and other functional front-end packages tbd during development.</p>
